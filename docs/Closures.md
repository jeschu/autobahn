and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewClosuresWithDefaults

`func NewClosuresWithDefaults() *Closures`

NewClosuresWithDefaults instantiates a new Closures object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetClosure

`func (o *Closures) GetClosure() []Closure`

GetClosure returns the Closure field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetClosureOk

`func (o *Closures) GetClosureOk() (*[]Closure, bool)`

GetClosureOk returns a tuple with the Closure field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetClosure

SetClosure sets Closure field to given value.
